    <h3>About Karen Sue</h3>
    <p>
    In 2009, our mom, Karen Sue Danielson, was diagnosed with Stage
    3B Inflammatory Breast Cancer (IBC). IBC is not detectable in
    mammograms, so usually by the time it is diagnosed, as with
    our mom, it has already spread. She fought long and hard, never
    giving up faith, never giving up hope. We originally started
    the golf tournament to support alternative treatments outside
    of the country for our mother. Unfortunately, she lost her
    battle with cancer in September 2011.
    </p>
    <h3>Keeping a promise</h3>
    <p>
    We made a promise to her that we would run the tournament no
    matter what happened for as long as we could to support a cause
    close to her heart. This is our eleventh year and we are hoping
    that itâ€™s our biggest.

    Mom was an unbelievably loving and caring woman. Always there
    to lend a hand, flash a smile, say the right words, or just 
    give you a warm hug. She always knew what to do and when to 
    do it. Our parents were foster parents and our mom had a strong
    passion to help kids less fortunate. We are very proud, and 
    honored to have a partnership with the <%= Charity.name %> in which
    all the funds we raise go to.

    <h3>Thank you</h3>
    <p>
    Thank you for your support and for keeping our mom's legacy 
    alive and strong!
